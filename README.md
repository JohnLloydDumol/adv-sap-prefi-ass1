## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).
is an architectural strategy that makes it possible for software parts
to communicate with one another and be reused through service interfaces.
Services may be quickly integrated into new applications by using an architectural 
pattern and common interface standards.

2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
A design paradigm known as Standardized Service Contract, Loose Coupling, and 
Service Actual leverages common systems to provide services to extra apps over 
the protocol; this is only an idea and isn't specified in certain programming languages.
Supports loose coupling everywhere in the project.
Supports interoperability.
Increases the quality of service.
Supports vendor diversity.
Promotes discovery and federation.
According to one of many definitions of SOA, a service has four properties

3. Define Microservices.
A subset of service-oriented architectures (SOA) known as microservices makes it possible 
for software systems to be adaptable and independently deployable. Microservices are controlled 
by tiny, independent teams and are frequently used for developing constantly deployed applications.

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
Independently manageable services
Enables more and more services as the need arises
Minimizes the impact on existing service
Possible to change or upgrade each service individually rather than upgrading in the entire application
Greater employee productivity

5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
So the differences of SOA and Micoroservices are
-Architecture, The software in a microservices architecture is made up of a number of little services, 
each of which carries out a specific task autonomously.
Consequently, we may conclude that there is the least amount of resource sharing throughout the services. 
However, services in SOA are more expansive 
and try to share as many resources as they can.

-Component Sharing
Microservices are resilient to failure since they don't often need to share components because they are 
independent of one another.
Furthermore, in contrast to SOA, the absence of component sharing enables developers to scale individual 
services much more quickly and implement the most recent versions. 
Sharing of components is a prevalent practice in SOA. As a result, a problem with one service may 
impact how well the other related services work.

-Granularity
Because they are independent of one another and don't frequently need to share components, 
microservices are robust against failure.
Moreover, the lack of component sharing allows developers to scale individual services much faster and 
use the latest versions, which is different from SOA. 
In SOA, component sharing is a common practice. Because of this, an issue with one service could affect how well the other services that are related function.

and the similaritis are
Both are collections that focus on performing specific functions.
Both are smaller in overall scope than one large monolithic architecture.
Both require decentralization in the internal culture with cross-functional collaborative abilities.
Both allow the choice of program languages that best suit each service.
